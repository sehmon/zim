====== Request ======
Created Monday 03 March 2014

A request is made of 3 parts


-The request line, which tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, etc.) and what resource it's looking for;

-The header, which sends the server additional information (such as which client is making the request)

-The body, which can be empty (as in a GET request) or contain data (if you're POSTing or PUTing information, that information is contained here).

Example:
// POST /codecademy/learn-http HTTP/1.1
// Host: www.codecademy.com
// Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
// Name=Eric&Age=26
