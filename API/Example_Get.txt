====== Example Get ======
Created Monday 03 March 2014

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "http://www.codecademy.com/", false);
xhr.send();
console.log(xhr.status);
console.log(xhr.statusText);

Go ahead and do three things:

Create a variable called xhr and set it equal to new XMLHttpRequest().

Call open xhr and pass it three arguments: "GET" (the type of request you'd like to make), "http://www.codecademy.com/" (the URL), and false (this means the exercise will wait until it gets a response from the server).

Call .send() on xhr. We've already taken care of the console.log()s for you!
