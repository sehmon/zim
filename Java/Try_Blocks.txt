====== Try Blocks ======
Created Saturday 18 January 2014

try{
The possibly dangerous code that you want to run
} catch(Exception e) {
the exception that you catch when it is thrown and the code you want to run if it happens
} finally{
The code that you want to run no matter what happens with the try block
}

Make sure you put the smaller catch blocks on the top

If you are creating a method that might catch an exception, you can make your method also throw the exception, thus allowing the method above it to catch the exception, Page 337
