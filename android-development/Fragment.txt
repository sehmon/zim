A fragment is a controller object that an activity can deputize to perform tasks. Most commonly, the task is managing a user interface. The user interface can be an entire screen or just one part of the screen.
A fragment managing a user interface is known as a UI fragment. A UI fragment has a view of its own that is inflated from a layout file. The fragmentâ€™s view contains the interesting UI elements that the user wants to see and interact with.{{./pasted_image.png}}

Using UI fragments separates the UI of your app into building blocks, which is useful for more than just list-detail applications. Working with individual blocks, it is easy to build tab interfaces, tack on animated sidebars, and more.

To get a result from a fragment you use **Fragment.startActivityForResult**
