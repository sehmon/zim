====== Activity Methods ======
Created Friday 03 January 2014

In Startup order:

onCreate() - creates startup logic the first time the app is introduced into the memory

onStart()

onResume() - when the user is currently interacting with the user

In Shutdown order():

onPause() - when the user is obscured by another activty. Cant interact with the user i.e. when a dialog box is over the activity
	camera
	gps
	shut off sound/video
	end animations
	
onStop() - all data used by the user is retained but cant be interacted with. data is normally saved here. not visible at all on the screen

onRestart - any restorative work needed when going from start to resume. not really used
onDestroy() - 

resume, pause, and stop are the only ones that can happen over a longer period of time

Android Manifest- on startup the system calls onCreate from MainActiviy.java
	<activity> holds the start for the application
	
onSaveInstanceState- Used to serialize data to save for later, make sure to make custom classes Serializable if you want to use this in your classes
