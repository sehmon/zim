====== Logs ======
Created Wednesday 05 February 2014

When you use the android.util.Log class to send log messages, you control not only the content of a message, but also a level that specifies how important the message is. Android supports five log levels, shown in Figure 3.17. Each level has a corresponding method in the Log class. Sending output to the log is as simple as calling the corresponding Log method.

Examples of Logging:

// Log a message at "debug" log level
Log.d(TAG, "Current question index: " + mCurrentIndex);

TrueFalse question;
try {
    question = mAnswerKey[mCurrentIndex];
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ex) {
    // Log a message at "error" log level, along with an exception stack trace
    Log.e(TAG, "Index was out of bounds", ex);
}
