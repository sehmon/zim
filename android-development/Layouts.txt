====== Layouts ======
Created Sunday 23 February 2014

Attributes whose names do not begin with layout_ are directions to the widget. When it is inflated, the widget calls a method to configure itself based on each of these attributes and their values.

When an attribute’s name begins with layout_, that attribute is a direction to that widget’s parent. These attributes are known as layout parameters, and they tell the parent layout how to arrange the child element within the parent
