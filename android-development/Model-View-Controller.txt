====== Model-View-Controller ======
Created Monday 03 February 2014

Android apps are based off of MVC architecture. It states that any object in your application must be a model, view, or a controller. 

Model- A model holds the apps data. They hold and manage data (TrueFalse class in GeoQuiz)

View- A view is an object that knows how to react to user input and draw itself on the screen. "If you can see it on the screen then it is a view". They also know how to respond to user input. (activity_quiz.xml for GeoQuiz)

Controller- blend together Models and Views. Designed to respond to the various events triggered by views and use the events to update or change the state of a model. (Activity, Fragment or Service)
