====== Views ======
Created Wednesday 29 January 2014

A view in Android represents a widget, e.g., a button, or a layout manager.

All views in Android extend the android.view.View class. This class is relatively large (greater than 18 000 lines of code) and provides a lot of base functionality for subclasses. Customer can implement their own views by extending android.view.View.


To use a view in a fragment, use the getView() function
