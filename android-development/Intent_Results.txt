====== Intent Results ======
Created Wednesday 05 February 2014

There are two methods you can call in the child activity to send data back to the parent:

    public final void setResult(int resultCode)
    public final void setResult(int resultCode, Intent data)

Typically, the result code is one of two pre-defined constants: Activity.RESULT_OK or Activity.RESULT_CANCELED. (You can use another constant, RESULT_FIRST_USER, as an offset when defining your own result codes.)

Setting result codes is useful when the parent needs to take different action depending on how the child activity finished.

For example, if a child activity had an OK button and a Cancel button, the child activity would set a different result code depending on which button was pressed. Then the parent activity would take different action depending on the result code.
